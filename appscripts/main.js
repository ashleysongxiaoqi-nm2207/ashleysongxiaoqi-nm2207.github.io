// main.js


// Hello only appears once because the function is executed only when it is called and it is only called once.

// Track the number of clicks. It can do this by increasing the value of the counter variable that you set in Step 1e, by 1.


// Change the text in the header element to read something like "OK, I have now received X clicks" (where X is the click count). So comment out the command for Step 1f and write a new one to achieve this instead.


// Now make it lie: have it print out 100 times the number of actual clicks it has received.
